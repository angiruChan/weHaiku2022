            <p> Historically, there are only a few poets in Japan who, over the centuries, have become respected for
                their haiku poetry. Among these are Basho, Buson, Issa, and Shiki. Of these four, the most famous is
                Basho. He is credited with making haiku a revered form of poetry. Before Basho refined the haiku poem,
                its form of 17 syllables had been used, but not with the simplicity and depth of meaning that Basho
                brought to the form.</p>
            <p> Basho was born in 1644 in the city of Ueno. His father was a samurai of lower rank in the service of the
                Todo family. When Basho was nine years old, he became a study companion to the Todo family heir,
                Yoshitada. These two became great friends and studied the art of linked verse under a famous writer of
                the time, Teitoku. Yoshitada died at the age of 25, leaving Basho crushed with grief. Basho asked to be
                released from service to the Todo family, but his request was denied, so he ran away to Kyoto. </p>
            <p>It is believed that he spent several years there in a temple studying the Chinese and Japanese classics.</p>

            <p> Basho began writing poetry for publication in 1676. Over the next four years, his poetry appeared in
                numerous anthologies, and he found himself with pupils whose poems were also being published. However,
                he was dissatisfied with his writing and eventually relocated to a tiny cottage by a river. He began to
                withdraw from the world around him as he lived alone. His poems during this time period show signs of
                spiritual sorrow.</p>
            <p> During this period of misery, Basho began studying Zen meditation with the help of a priest. He is
                believed to have remarked that he had one foot in the other world and one in this world, which leads us
                to assume that meditation did not lead to enlightenment for him. Basho's mansion was destroyed by fire
                in 1682. His subsequent two-year works illustrate his resultant agony as he strove to create his own
                manner of communication.</p>
            <p>His writing took on a mature, knowing style, representing the spiritual distance he had traveled.
                Anthologies of his works were published during this period, including Spring Days, a collection of his
                own and his pupils' poems containing Basho's most famous haiku:</p>

            <p> Basho continued to travel and write, but in 1692 he moved into a house and lived alone for the next two
                and a half years. His separation from life is reflected in his poems during these years. In 1694, he
                embarked on his final major journey. The poetry from this most recent journey convey a sense of gloom.
            </p>
            <p> Basho's health was failing, so he began writing his death bed poems, which he dictated to one of his
                followers. Basho passed away on October 12, 1694. His compositions have stood the test of time and
                are now regarded as those of a great poet,
